# Foodegy
Features include swiping left and right on food one likes or dislikes. The app will show fast food/restaurants, within a 1 mile radius of CSUN, based on the swipes. The app will then allow for one to choose a place to order from, or it can randomly choose one.

We'll be using **Expo** to make it easy to test the app as you code.

__Installing Expo__

First you need to get node.js:

https://nodejs.org/en/

Then follow these instructions to install Expo cli:

https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/

Then grab the Expo Go app on your phone. Make sure your phone and your computer are on the same network.

Once you have all that installed, navigate to project folder inside your terminal and enter:

`expo start`

If this is your first launch, you'll need to scan a QR code. After that the app should pop-up.

__Running Tests__

This project uses JTest to run tests. After installation, test can be run with:

`npm run test`
